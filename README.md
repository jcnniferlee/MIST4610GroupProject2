# DATA SET DESCRIPTION
Our data set details Crime Data from 2020 to Present from the Los Angeles Open Data Portal. We obtained our data set on the provided website [Catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present). It includes all crimes reported to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) since January 1, 2020. It has around 1.2M rows and 28 columns, where each row represents a single reported crime. The dataset includes information like the date and time the crime occurred, the type of crime, the LAPD area where it happened, victim details (like age, gender, and race), and even the weapon used if applicable. It also includes location data (latitude and longitude). Most of the data is in the form of dates, strings, integers, and floats. 

The String data type was used in fields including the type of crime, the location it took place in, and the descent of the crime's victim. The Number datatype was used in fields including the report number, the codes of the crimes committed, and the area of LA that the crime took place in. The DateTime datatype includes fields that detail the time the crime occurred as well as the time that the crime was officially reported. Overall, this dataset uses different datatypes in numerous ways to report data about crimes in Los Angeles.

# QUESTION 1
Since the beginning of 2025, has there been a correlation or occurrence of violent crimes in certain areas of LA, and what spatial patterns can be identified across the city?

# VISUALIZATION 1

The bar chart above shows the differences in violent crimes between 2024 and 2025 from January through March for both years. The yellow bars represent the violent crimes in 2024 and the green bars represent 2025.

The same information is also presented through another visualization mapping out the different violent crimes between 2024 and 2025 through January and March. 

# ANALYSIS 
After analyzing the data, we are able to concur that in comparison to the first three months of 2024, the first three months of 2025 had a significantly lower crime rate. The total count in 2024 amounts to 52,616 while the total count in 2025 amounts to 257. This is roughly 200 times smaller than the amount of crimes in 2024. We were also able to find that crime decreased disproportionately with there being less crime overall but noticed that there was a particularly large decrease in central and west LA specifically. While this stark contrast may be attributed to reports not being filed in the first few months of 2025, we can also draw to the conclusion that this may be due to the effectiveness of new distrtict attorney Nathan Hochman. After being sworn into office on December 3rd, 2024, Hochman focused much of his attention on the prioritization and implementation  of policies that enforced LAPD focus on high-crime zones. 

# IMPORTANCE
This question is important as it allows us to draw conclusions about which specific government policies worked and which did not. In determining which policies are effective and which are not, public officials are able to eliminate
