# DATA SET DESCRIPTION
Our data set details Crime Data from 2020 to Present from the Los Angeles Open Data Portal. We obtained our data set on the provided website [Catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present). It includes all crimes reported to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) since January 1, 2020. It has around 1.2M rows and 28 columns, where each row represents a single reported crime. The dataset includes information like the date and time the crime occurred, the type of crime, the LAPD area where it happened, victim details (like age, gender, and race), and even the weapon used if applicable. It also includes location data (latitude and longitude). Most of the data is in the form of dates, strings, integers, and floats. 

The String data type was used in fields including the type of crime, the location it took place in, and the descent of the crime's victim. The Number datatype was used in fields including the report number, the codes of the crimes committed, and the area of LA that the crime took place in. The DateTime datatype includes fields that detail the time the crime occurred as well as the time that the crime was officially reported. Overall, this dataset uses different datatypes in numerous ways to report data about crimes in Los Angeles.

# QUESTION 1:
Since the beginning of 2025, has there been a correlation or occurrence of violent crimes in certain areas of LA, and what spatial patterns can be identified across the city?
